## About me
Hello, everyone. My name is Leonid, I am Frontend-developer.
If this repo isn't still full of nice project, that means that i still work somewhere hahah :)
But some of my ideas came to code and may lay here. Here they are:

## Projects
- **yandex_messanger** - project, wich succeeded goal is to make typescript only app. some parts may be extractet to a separate library, but i don't want to :)
- **Asteroids** - maybe the one worthy project here. Web-game, based on canvas. Portal around the game made whith react, redux, redux-saga, node.js. fully installable app, can be played offline.
- chat_* - a bunch of repos, that were made for my insane idea to make a comparative analysis of SwiftUI and react.
	- **chat_api** - web-api for chat based on .net core and modgoDb.
	- **chat_web** - fast-maked react spa with only login screen for now.
	- **chat_swiftui** - same as above, but within swiftui
- **redux-saga** - first expiriance with redux-saga. searching weather in your place, using free public api.
- **moovie_searcher** - first expiriance with react. searches moovies on input, using free public api :)
